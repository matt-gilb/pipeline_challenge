# Mini data-pipeline request

## Overview
Build a reliable pipeline that powers Trust & Safety workflows. We value clean, well-structured, and scalable solutions which reflect real-world infrastructure challenges in the abuse-prevention domain.

## Description
Design and implement a mini data-platform for Trust & Safety, with **two key components**:
* A **data ingestion & pipeline service** that receives high-volume event streams and processes them into usable, queryable datasets.
* A **dashboard / query layer** that enables T&S team to explore metrics, monitor data quality, and support rule enforcement decisions.

### Technical Requirements
* The system must support ingesting a simulated stream of events
* Build an **ETL/ELT or streaming** pipeline in real-time (not near real-time)
* Ensure system is designed for scale
* Ensure correctness

### Constraints
* Technology stack: TypeScript is required; other technologies are at your discretion
* Submission format: Git repository with deployment links

### Evaluation Criteria
* Product thinking about the solution
* Solution architecture and overall approach
* Code quality, organization, and TypeScript usage
* Documentation quality and completeness
* Data correctness & schema strategy
